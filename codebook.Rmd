#Codebook

###This codebook summarizes the output data fields from "FinalTidyOutput.txt"

##Identifiers
Subjects and Activity type are tracked in the following fields   
* SubjectID: Number associated with each subject in the study   
* ActivityID: Number associated with each Activity Description   
* ActivityDescription: Description of activity performed by the study subjects   

##Activity Descriptions

* Walking   
* Walking_Upstairs  
* Walking_Downstairs  
* Sitting   
* Standing   
* Laying
